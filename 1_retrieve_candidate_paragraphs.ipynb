      "para_text  :In the first class action pending in Canada, Cecilia Létourneau v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada, filed in September 1998, our subsidiary and other Canadian manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-MacDonald Corp.) are defendants.  The plaintiff, an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005.  Trial began in March 2012 and concluded in December 2014. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015. The trial court found our subsidiary and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and awarded a total of CAD 131 million (approximately $100 million) in punitive damages, allocating CAD 46 million (approximately $35 million) to our subsidiary. The trial court found that defendants violated the Civil Code of Quebec, the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, and the Quebec Consumer Protection Act by failing to warn adequately of the dangers of smoking. The trial court also found that defendants conspired to prevent consumers from learning the dangers of smoking. The trial court further held that these civil faults were a cause of the class members' addiction. The trial court rejected other grounds of fault advanced by the class, holding that: (i) the evidence was insufficient to show that defendants marketed to youth, (ii) defendants' advertising did not convey false information about the characteristics of cigarettes, and (iii) defendants did not commit a fault by using the descriptors light or mild for cigarettes with a lower tar delivery. The trial court estimated the size of the addiction class at 918,000 members but declined to award compensatory damages to the addiction class because the evidence did not establish the claims with sufficient accuracy. The trial court ordered defendants to pay the full punitive damage award into a trust within 60 days and found that a claims process to allocate the awarded damages to individual class members would be too expensive and difficult to administer. The trial court ordered a briefing on the proposed process for the distribution of sums remaining from the punitive damage award after payment of attorneys' fees and legal costs. In June 2015, our subsidiary commenced the appellate process by filing its inscription of appeal of the trial court's judgment with the Court of Appeal of Quebec. Our subsidiary also filed a motion to cancel the trial court's order for payment into a trust within 60 days notwithstanding appeal. In July 2015, the Court of Appeal granted the motion to cancel and overturned the trial court's ruling that our subsidiary make the payment into a trust within 60 days. In August 2015, plaintiffs filed a motion with the Court of Appeal seeking security in both the Létourneau case and the Blais case described below. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal granted the motion and ordered our subsidiary to furnish security totaling CAD 226 million (approximately $173 million), in the form of cash into a court trust or letters of credit, in six equal consecutive quarterly installments of approximately CAD 37.6 million (approximately $28.7 million) beginning in December 2015 through March 2017. See the Blais description for further detail concerning the security order. The Court of Appeal heard oral arguments on the merits appeal in November 2016. Our subsidiary and PMI believe that the findings of liability and damages were incorrect and should ultimately be set aside on any one of many grounds, including the following: (i) holding that defendants violated Quebec law by failing to warn class members of the risks of smoking even after the court found that class members knew, or should have known, of the risks, (ii) finding that plaintiffs were not required to prove that defendants' alleged misconduct caused injury to each class member in direct contravention of binding precedent, (iii) creating a factual presumption, without any evidence from class members or otherwise, that defendants' alleged misconduct caused all smoking by all class members, (iv) holding that the addiction class members' claims for punitive damages were not time-barred even though the case was filed more than three years after a prominent addiction warning appeared on all packages, and (v) awarding punitive damages to punish defendants without proper consideration as to whether punitive damages were necessary to deter future misconduct.\n",

      "para_text  :TABLE OF CONTENTS The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government and qui tam relators have brought False Claims Act actions against pharmaceutical companies on the theory that their practices have caused false claims to be presented to the government. There is also a separate false claims provision imposing criminal penalties. Other federal healthcare fraud-related laws also provide criminal liability for violations. The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute (18 U.S.C. §1347) prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Federal criminal law at 18 U.S.C. §1001, among other sections, prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Other Laws The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, and physician ownership and investment interests. Payments made to physicians and research institutions for clinical trials are included within the ambit of this law. A number of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Some state anti-kickback statutes apply not just to government payors, but to all payors, including commercial payors. Employees As of December 31, 2016, we had 456 employees, including 169 in research and development, 137 in our commercial organization, 66 in our medical affairs group and 84 in general and administrative supporting functions.

      "para_text  :TABLE OF CONTENTS Contracted Power - (continued) Seasonality Each CP facility has unique seasonality based on local market factors including weather and energy demand. The solar projects generate a disproportionate amount of their revenue in the summer months when insolation is highest, while wind energy revenues vary by season depending on the location of the specific project. Other CP projects may also exhibit seasonality based on the respective market's varying electricity demand. For example, BEC is a peaking power plant that is dispatched when energy demand increases above a base load, therefore BEC is dispatched more often in the summer and winter months. Competition The contracted portion of CP's business is not subject to substantial direct competitive price pressure due to the long-term nature of the PPAs and tolling agreements with creditworthy off-takers. Our BEC facility has incremental generating capacity which is available for sale in the spot power market. After the expiration of the PPAs or tolling agreements, our facilities could be subject to greater competition. Regulation The power and energy sectors are the subject of substantial and complex laws, rules and regulations. Sector regulators include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The FERC has jurisdiction over the transmission and wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce and over the transportation, storage and certain sales of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the rates, charges and other terms and conditions for such services. The NERC serves to establish and enforce reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk power system. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also oversees certain environmental matters related to the construction and operations of CP's electric generating facilities. The New York competitive wholesale electricity market in which BEC participates is administered by the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). NYISO is a not-for-profit agency that serves to ensure regional grid reliability, comprehensive planning, and open and efficient markets. BEC is also subject to certain New York State and New York City regulations and to environmental regulations by the State of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection. Each of the solar and wind facilities comprising CP is subject to regulation and oversight in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Employees and Management At December 31, 2016, the CP businesses had seven employees and two contractors that provide certain management oversight, while O&M is provided by third parties. MIC Hawaii Industry Overview Beginning in 2008 with the Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative, Hawaii implemented a RPS that required increasing levels of electricity be derived from renewable resources with the goal of generating cleaner and lower cost electricity. In 2015, Hawaii accelerated its RPS and currently targets 100% of its electricity generated from renewable resources by 2045 with interim milestones in 2020, 2030 and 2040. MIC Hawaii's businesses support the State's clean energy goals of lowering emissions, increasing energy security and decreasing costs for all energy users in Hawaii. For example, at Hawaii Gas, we are focused on diversifying our feedstock to include fuels which are cleaner burning and have the potential to lower energy costs for our customers, such as renewable natural gas (RNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Further, natural gas-fired generation better complements Hawaii's growing renewable power generation sources given its efficiency and operating flexibility. At Waihonu Solar, we are generating renewable energy that serves customers on Oahu. At Critchfield Pacific, Inc. (CPI), we work with customers to lower their overall energy use through the design and construction of energy efficient infrastructure.\n",

      "para_text  :TABLE OF CONTENTS IMTT - (continued) Regulation The rates that IMTT charges for its services are not subject to regulation. However, a number of regulatory bodies oversee IMTT's operations. IMTT must comply with numerous federal, state and local environmental, occupational health and safety, security, tax and planning statutes and regulations. These regulations require IMTT to obtain and maintain permits to operate its facilities and impose standards that govern the way IMTT operates its business. If IMTT does not comply with the relevant regulations, it could lose its operating permits and/or incur fines and increased liability. As a result, IMTT has developed environmental and health and safety compliance functions overseen by terminal managers at the terminal level, as well as by IMTT's Vice President of Environmental, Health, Safety and Security, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Executive Officer. While changes in environmental, health and safety regulations pose a risk of higher operating costs, such changes are generally phased in over time to manage the impact on both the industry and the business. The Bayonne terminal has significant environmental remediation requirements that were partially assumed at the time of purchase from the various former owners. One former owner retained environmental remediation responsibilities for a purchased site as well as responsibility for sharing other remediation costs. Remediation efforts entail removal of the free product, groundwater control and treatment, soil treatment, repair/replacement of sewer systems, and the implementation of containment and monitoring systems. These remediation activities are expected to continue for an additional ten to twenty years. See \"Legal Proceedings\" in Part I, Item 3, for further discussions. The Lemont terminal has entered into a consent order with the State of Illinois to remediate contamination at the site that pre-dated IMTT's ownership. This remediation effort, including the implementation of extraction and monitoring wells and soil treatment, is estimated to continue for an additional ten to twenty years. Employees and Management As of December 31, 2016, IMTT (excluding the Newfoundland terminal) had a total of 1,052 employees, of which 230 employees were unionized. In January 2017, IMTT agreed to a new, five year collective bargaining agreement with its Bayonne employees represented by the United Steel Workers. This agreement is expected to be executed within the quarter ended March 31, 2017. We believe employee relations at IMTT are good. The day-to-day operations of IMTT are managed by individual terminal managers who are responsible for most aspects of the operations at their terminals. IMTT's operations are overseen by senior personnel with significant experience in the bulk liquid storage industry. Management of the business is headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana. Atlantic Aviation Industry Overview Fixed based operations (FBOs) primarily service the GA corporate and leisure flying segment of the air transportation industry. Local airport authorities own the airport properties and grant FBO operators the right to provide fueling and other services pursuant to long-term ground leases. Fueling services provide the majority of an FBO's revenue and gross margin. FBOs often operate in environments with high barriers to entry. Airports tend to have limited physical space for additional FBOs. Airport authorities generally do not have an incentive to add additional FBOs unless there is a significant demand for additional services. Government approvals and design and construction of a new FBO can also take significant time and require significant capital expenditures. Furthermore, airports typically impose minimum standards with respect to the experience, capital investment and breadth of services provided by the FBO.\n",

      "para_text  :TABLE OF CONTENTS Atlantic Aviation - (continued) Competition Atlantic Aviation directly competes with other FBO operators at more than half of its locations. The FBOs compete on the basis of location of the facility relative to runways and street access, service, safety, value-added features, reliability and price. Each FBO also faces competitive pressure from the fact that aircraft may take on sufficient fuel at one location and not need to refuel at a specific destination. FBO operators also face indirect competition from facilities located at nearby airports. Atlantic Aviation's main competitors are Signature Flight Support, Jet Aviation, Million Air, Sheltair Aviation and TAC Air. In February 2016, Signature Flight Support acquired Landmark Aviation, resulting in the combination of two of Atlantic Aviation's biggest competitors. Signature Flight Support competes with Atlantic at 22 airports, but only three of these locations were added as a result of the merger. Atlantic Aviation has not noticed a significant shift in customer or competitor behavior and remains confident in its ability to compete effectively. To our knowledge, other than the competitors listed, no other competitor operated more than 20 FBOs in the U.S. at December 31, 2016. Customers Atlantic Aviation does not depend on a single customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the business. Regulation The aviation industry is overseen by a number of regulatory bodies, but its primary regulator is the FAA. In addition, local airport authorities also regulate the FBOs. The business must comply with federal, state and local environmental statutes and regulations associated in part with the operation of fuel storage tank systems and mobile fueling vehicles. These requirements include, among other things, tank and pipe testing for tightness, soil sampling for evidence of leaking and remediation of detected leaks and spills. Atlantic Aviation's FBOs are subject to regular inspection by federal and local environmental agencies as well as local fire departments and other agencies. The business does not expect that compliance and related remediation work, if any, will have a material negative impact on earnings or the competitive position of Atlantic Aviation. The business has not received notice requiring it to cease operations at any location or of any abatement proceeding by any government agency as a result of failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Employees and Management As of December 31, 2016, the business employed 1,956 people, of which 190 employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe relations with union and non-union employees at Atlantic Aviation are good. The day-to-day operations of Atlantic Aviation are managed by individual site managers who are responsible for most aspects of the operations at their site. Atlantic Aviation's operations are overseen by senior personnel with significant experience in the aviation industry. Contracted Power Industry Overview The power industry represents a large and critical infrastructure market, both in terms of the number and value of facilities as well as their contribution to overall economic activity. In developed economies, capital spending in the sector is driven by aging infrastructure, new technologies, increased legislation regarding emissions, the use of renewable energy and modest demand growth. The Energy Information Administration forecasts the demand for electricity in the U.S. to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 0.7% over the next twenty years. As aging and inefficient generating capacity is retired or replaced, opportunities for deployment of capital in the growth of our CP segment are expected to increase.\n",
