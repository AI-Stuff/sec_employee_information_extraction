      "The Company has a sales force of 11 employees that sell to and service most customers. A few selected accounts are handled by manufacturers' representatives who may also sell other product lines. Sales promotional activities are conducted primarily through the use of newspaper advertising, in store promotions, and digital advertising. The business is seasonal, with the normal peak sales period occurring in the fourth quarter of the year prior to the holiday season. This segment operates in a highly competitive and extremely price sensitive environment. Increased costs that cannot be fully absorbed into the price of products or passed along in the form of price increases to the retail customer can have a significant adverse impact on operating results. Several companies compete for sales of housewares and small electrical appliances, some of which are larger than the Company's segment and others which are smaller. In addition, some customers maintain their own private label, as well as purchase brokered product directly from the Orient. Product competition extends to special product features, product pricing, product quality, marketing programs, warranty provisions, service policies and other factors. New product introductions are an important part of the Company's sales to offset the morbidity rate of other products and/or the effect of lowered acceptance of seasonal products due to weather conditions. New products entail unusual risks. Engineering and tooling costs are increasingly expensive, as are finished goods that may not have a ready market or achieve widespread consumer acceptance. High-cost advertising commitments which may accompany such new products or may be required to maintain sales of existing products may not be fully absorbed by ultimate product sales. Initial production schedules, set in advance of introduction, carry the possibility of excess unsold inventories. New product introductions are further subject to delivery delays from supply sources, which can impact availability for the Company's most active selling periods.\n",

      "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The Company has several stock-based employee and director compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Compensation cost for share-based awards is recorded on a straight line basis over the required service period, based on the fair value of the award. The fair value of the stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions, including dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, the estimated length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (expected term) and the estimated volatility of the Company's common stock price over the expected term. These assumptions are generally based on historical averages of the Company. Furthermore, in calculating compensation expense for these awards, the Company is also required to estimate the extent to which options will be forfeited prior to vesting. Many factors are considered when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. To the extent actual results or updated estimates of forfeiture differ from current estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment to the previously recorded amounts.\n",

In some cases the Dutch requirement is more stringent, such as by requiring a longer \"look- back\" period (five years) for former executive directors and employees and by requiring that only one non-executive board member may be not independent. The Dutch Code recommends, specifically for one-tier governance structures, that a majority of the members of the board be non-executive and independent. Currently, a majority of our Board (7 of the 13 members) is \"independent\" under the NYSE definition and the Dutch Code. Because two or more of our 11 non-executive directors are not independent we deviate from the Dutch Code's general best practice provision regarding the maximum number of non-executives that may not be independent.

The rules mandate a \"three prong\" outreach program; i.e., Prong 1: widely disseminate information concerning each full-time (30 hours or more) job vacancy, except for vacancies filled in exigent circumstances; Prong 2: provide notice of each full-time job vacancy to recruitment organizations that have requested such notice; and Prong 3: complete two (for broadcast employment units with five to ten full-time employees or that are located in smaller markets) or four (for employment units with more than ten full-time employees located in larger markets) longer-term recruitment initiatives within a two-year period. These include, for example, job fairs, scholarship and internship programs, and other community events designed to inform the public as to employment opportunities in broadcasting. The rules mandate extensive record keeping and reporting requirements. The EEO rules are enforced through review at renewal time, at mid-term for larger broadcasters, and through random audits and targeted investigations resulting from information received as to possible violations. The FCC has not yet decided on whether and how to apply the EEO rule to part-time positions. Failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of \"short\" (less than the full eight-year) renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license.\n",

A few selected accounts are handled by manufacturers' representatives who may also sell other product lines. Sales promotional activities are conducted primarily through the use of newspaper advertising, in store promotions, and digital advertising. The business is seasonal, with the normal peak sales period occurring in the fourth quarter of the year prior to the holiday season. This segment operates in a highly competitive and extremely price sensitive environment. Increased costs that cannot be fully absorbed into the price of products or passed along in the form of price increases to the retail customer can have a significant adverse impact on operating results. Several companies compete for sales of housewares and small electrical appliances, some of which are larger than the Company's segment and others which are smaller. In addition, some customers maintain their own private label, as well as purchase brokered product directly from the Orient. Product competition extends to special product features, product pricing, product quality, marketing programs, warranty provisions, service policies and other factors. New product introductions are an important part of the Company's sales to offset the morbidity rate of other products and/or the effect of lowered acceptance of seasonal products due to weather conditions. New products entail unusual risks. Engineering and tooling costs are increasingly expensive, as are finished goods that may not have a ready market or achieve widespread consumer acceptance. High-cost advertising commitments which may accompany such new products or may be required to maintain sales of existing products may not be fully absorbed by ultimate product sales. Initial production schedules, set in advance of introduction, carry the possibility of excess unsold inventories. New product introductions are further subject to delivery delays from supply sources, which can impact availability for the Company's most active selling periods.\n",

Under the ESPP, the Company was authorized to issue up to 1.0 million shares of common stock to qualifying full-time employees whose total annual base salary was less than $90,000. The Company's board of directors amended the Company's ESPP effective October 1, 2005 to provide that participants may acquire shares under the ESPP at a 5% discount from fair market value on the last day of the ESPP year rather than a 15% discount prior to the amendment. Employees can choose each year to have up to 15% of their annual base earnings or $9,500, whichever is lower, withheld to purchase the Company's common stock. Under the Compensation - Stock Compensation Topic of the Codification, shares issued under the ESPP as amended are non-compensatory. Under the ESPP, the Company sold 2,470 shares, 2,688 shares and 3,146 shares to employees in Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n",

The accident involved the deflagration of solid rocket propellant following a remote cutting operation and resulted in injuries to two employees, one of whom ultimately died from his injuries.  Cal\\OSHA issued nine citations relating to the accident with penalties of approximately $0.1 million, all of which the Company has appealed. The BOI is the criminal investigatory arm of Cal\\OSHA and is required by law to investigate any occupational fatality to determine if criminal charges will be recommended. In August 2016, the BOI advised that it had completed its investigation and the criminal aspect of the case was closed. A pre-hearing conference on the Company's appeal of the citations was originally scheduled for January 9, 2017, but was postponed and will be rescheduled.\n"
