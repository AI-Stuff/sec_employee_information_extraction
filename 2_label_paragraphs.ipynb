To obtain and maintain a U.L. listing, a security system monitoring center must be located in a building meeting U.L.'s structural requirements, have back-up computer and power systems, and meet U.L. specifications for staffing and standard operating procedures. Many jurisdictions have laws requiring that security systems for certain buildings be monitored by U.L.-listed centers. In addition, a U.L. listing is required by insurers of certain customers as a condition of insurance coverage. Our monitoring centers are fully redundant, which means that in the event of an emergency at one of our monitoring centers such as fire, tornado, major interruption in telephone or computer service, or any other event affecting the functionality of the center, all monitoring operations can be automatically transferred to another monitoring center.

In some cases the Dutch requirement is more stringent, such as by requiring a longer \"look- back\" period (five years) for former executive directors and employees and by requiring that only one non-executive board member may be not independent. The Dutch Code recommends, specifically for one-tier governance structures, that a majority of the members of the board be non-executive and independent.

The rules mandate a \"three prong\" outreach program; i.e., Prong 1: widely disseminate information concerning each full-time (30 hours or more) job vacancy, except for vacancies filled in exigent circumstances; Prong 2: provide notice of each full-time job vacancy to recruitment organizations that have requested such notice; and Prong 3: complete two (for broadcast employment units with five to ten full-time employees or that are located in smaller markets) or four (for employment units with more than ten full-time employees located in larger markets) longer-term recruitment initiatives within a two-year period. These include, for example, job fairs, scholarship and internship programs, and other community events designed to inform the public as to employment opportunities in broadcasting. The rules mandate extensive record keeping and reporting requirements. The EEO rules are enforced through review at renewal time, at mid-term for larger broadcasters, and through random audits and targeted investigations resulting from information received as to possible violations. The FCC has not yet decided on whether and how to apply the EEO rule to part-time positions.

      "The Company has a sales force of 11 employees that sell to and service most customers. A few selected accounts are handled by manufacturers' representatives who may also sell other product lines. Sales promotional activities are conducted primarily through the use of newspaper advertising, in store promotions, and digital advertising. The business is seasonal, with the normal peak sales period occurring in the fourth quarter of the year prior to the holiday season. This segment operates in a highly competitive and extremely price sensitive environment. Increased costs that cannot be fully absorbed into the price of products or passed along in the form of price increases to the retail customer can have a significant adverse impact on operating results. Several companies compete for sales of housewares and small electrical appliances, some of which are larger than the Company's segment and others which are smaller. In addition, some customers maintain their own private label, as well as purchase brokered product directly from the Orient. Product competition extends to special product features, product pricing, product quality, marketing programs, warranty provisions, service policies and other factors. New product introductions are an important part of the Company's sales to offset the morbidity rate of other products and/or the effect of lowered acceptance of seasonal products due to weather conditions. New products entail unusual risks. Engineering and tooling costs are increasingly expensive, as are finished goods that may not have a ready market or achieve widespread consumer acceptance. High-cost advertising commitments which may accompany such new products or may be required to maintain sales of existing products may not be fully absorbed by ultimate product sales. Initial production schedules, set in advance of introduction, carry the possibility of excess unsold inventories. New product introductions are further subject to delivery delays from supply sources, which can impact availability for the Company's most active selling periods.\n",
